# Evidence Ledger (FounderGate-CTO-maintained)

> **Plain English.** This is the living evidence record for the Assembly Manual V1.2 bundle run. The FounderGate
> CTO (Harvest Terminal) maintains it automatically; the founder reads it only at gates. **No DONE row may exist
> without an evidence path and an exact SHA. Anything not checked in the current run is UNKNOWN.**
>
> This is the *live* ledger. The template lives in Assembly Manual §16 (`docs/ASSEMBLY_MANUAL.md`), which is kept
> byte-identical and is therefore not edited in place.

**Legend:** `#B0PR` and `B0SHA` are stamped with the real PR number and the exact merge commit SHA immediately
after the sheriff merge (living-ledger maintenance, not a second bundle PR). Until stamped they read as their
literal placeholder tokens, which count as UNKNOWN.
